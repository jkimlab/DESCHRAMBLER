 This extension needs the rest of the main bioperl distribution to
 function properly.  It is only useful as a helper module for the SeqIO
 system to read sequence trace files handled by the Staden package's
 io_lib "read" library.  You should have this library installed prior
 to installing Bio::SeqIO::staden::read, it's currently available at:
 
 https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=100316

 Currently, the Bio::SeqIO::staden::read extension only works with io_lib
 v. 1.8.11 or 1.8.12; v. 1.9 and higher have several prototype changes in the
 "read" library which have broken compatibility in those versions for now.
 It is possible these changes may be addressed in the future.

 Many users have noted that the io_lib install process often forgets
 to install the "os.h" file along with the rest of the include files;
 you may have to do this manually.  If so, you may also have to
 install the "config.h" file for "os.h" to find all the information it
 needs.  Finally, you may also need to edit "os.h" to #include
 <config.h> instead of #include "config.h" if you continue to get
 undefined symbol errors during compilation.  On some OSes you may in fact
 have to do the OPPOSITE, meaning change <config.h> to "config.h".

 The bioperl-ext make process will prompt you for the LIB and INCLUDE
 locations (usually /usr/local/lib and usr/local/include/io_lib,
 respectively) of the io_lib "libread" library and Read.h header files,
 after trying to automatically find them.  You may also specify these
 via the environment variables "IOLIB_LIB" and "IOLIB_INC", or via
 identically named options to perl Makefile.PL:
 
   perl Makefile.PL IOLIB_LIB=/opt/lib IOLIB_INC=/opt/include/io_lib
 
 Ignore any warnings about these options being unknown to MakeMaker.
 
 A failed compilation is most likely due to an incomplete io_lib
 installation; make sure that all the required io_lib ".h" files are in
 place (see above regarding "os.h" and "config.h").
